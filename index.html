        <h2>The Garfield Pipe</h2>
        <img src="https://github.com/ElijahCoferLuttmann/ElijahCoferLuttmann.github.io/blob/main/images.png?raw=true" alt="GARFIELD!!!!" class="center" style="width:300px">
        
         <p>The surface level of the strip is simple. We see a man. A plain-looking
               man who is not named in the comic (although we know he is 
               called Jon) with large collars symptomatic of the style back then 
               - he clearly cares about his appearance at least a little. Hes holding a newspaper,
               perhaps the Chicago Sun Times, which infamously dropped “Garfield” from its pages in the 
               1970s before public outcry forced them to reverse that decision.</p>
         <p>
           Is there a deeper meaning to this comic strip? What does the pipe represent?
